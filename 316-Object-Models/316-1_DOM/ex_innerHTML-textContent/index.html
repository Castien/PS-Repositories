    <!-- DOM elements have a couple of properties that can read and set their content:
        innerHTML - Used to retrieve/set content as HTML.
        textContent - Used to retrieve/set content as plain text. 
    
    innerHTML is an extremely powerful tool, which can allow for complete rewrites of DOM contents
    textContent is an efficient text manipulation tool
