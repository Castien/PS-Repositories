    <h1>Form Validation</h1>
    <div>
        The <code>required</code> attribute defines fields that must be filled out
        before a form can be submitted.
    </div>
    <div>
        The <code>minlength</code> and <code>maxlength</code> attributes define
        the length that an input must adhere to in order to be considered valid.
    </div>
    <div>
        The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes define the value that
        an input must adhere to in order to be considered valid.
    </div>
    <div>
        The <code>pattern</code> attribute provides powerful tools for matching an
        input to a desired format using regular expressions.
    </div>

            This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. -->
