// Express requires us to define routes
// By default, the web client is asking for the base route "/" from the server using an HTTP GET request
// Express routes have the following structure:

// app.method(path, handler)
// app is the instance of Express.
// method is the HTTP request method, in lowercase (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.).
// path is the URL path on the server, the endpoint.
// handler is the function executed when the route is matched.

// res.download()	Prompt a file to be downloaded.
// res.end()	End the response process.
// res.json()	Send a JSON response.
// res.jsonp()	Send a JSON response with JSONP support.
// res.redirect()	Redirect a request.
// res.render()	Render a view template.
// res.send()	Send a response of various types.
// res.sendFile()	Send a file as an octet stream.
// res.sendStatus()	Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body.

 * "/abc" - handles /abc

 * "/ab+cd" - handles /abcd, /abbbcd, /abbbbbbbcd, etc - one or more of the character before +
 * "/ab*cd" - "/ab" + anything + "cd" - wildcard, starting with ab and ending with cd
 * /a/ - RegExp: anything that contains "a"

// Route parameters are named segments of a URL, preceded by a colon (:),
// that are used to cache certain values, specified at their position in the URL.
// These values are cached in the req.params object, 
// with the name of the route parameter as the key used to access its value.
//   For example (a live example of this will follow):
//   For a route path: /users/:userID/profile/:data
//   and a request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/42/profile/43110
//   req.params contains: { userID: "42", data: "43110" }

// Middleware functions occur between the request being received and the response being sent
// Middleware has access to the request and response objects 
// and the next function in the request-response cycle, allowing it to chain into that next function.
// Middleware functions can:
// -Execute any code.
// -Make changes to the request and response objects.
// -End the request-response cycle.
// -Call the next piece of middleware in the stack.

// Middleware is particularly useful when handling anything that needs to be repeated
// for every request-response cycle, like cookie validation. 
// There is already a package that handles the parsing of cookies,
// so we just need to create and use a validation function.

// Use of third-party middleware using the cookie-parser module:
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

// Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. 
// You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function.
// Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature.
// Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware
// and will fail to handle errors.

// error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(400).send(err.message);
